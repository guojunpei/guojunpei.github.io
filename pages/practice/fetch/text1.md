# How to Become a More Effective Learner

Learning How to Learn, is a [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) course taught by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, Offered By McMaster University and University of California San Diego. I like the course, as a firm believer in lifelong learning, I'd like to keep improving my learning skills, therefore made this GitHub project, so maybe this can inspire others.
